Intro project to GitHub

Hello world

This is all very new for me, but I am excited to learn how this works. I have a project that I have been researching, and there are tools on GitHub that I think will help me with this project. Step one, understand how GitHub works. Hence, this project.

I really hate having such a common name. It makes finding user names really tough..
