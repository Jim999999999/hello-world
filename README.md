Intro project to GitHub

Hello world

This is all very new for me, but I am excited to learn how this works. I have a project that I have been researching, and there are tools on GitHub that I think will help me with this project. Step one, understand how GitHub works. Hence, this project.

I really hate having such a common name. It makes finding user names really tough..

I'm now trying my first edits to a github file. Yes, very exciting stuff here, i know. I really wanted to got to GitHub to use someone else published project, and I was hoping to just fast track to it (as that will be challenging enough), but i'm having trouble doing even that, so its the long slog of learning for me. Its for the best, I know, but i really want to jump into why i came here in the first place.  Speaking of wasting time, that seems to be what i'm doing now.
